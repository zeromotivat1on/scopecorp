- Logging from other threads cause crashes even log implementation is synchronized.
  This problem is observed in shader hot reload system.

- Enqueue draw command order is crucial for expected output, we need to add sort/priority
  of submitted draw commands. Also possible to add additional draw queues, e.g for ui.

- Change syntax of shader regions (like @vertex_begin ... @vertex_end), it will become
  more clean and less error prone.
